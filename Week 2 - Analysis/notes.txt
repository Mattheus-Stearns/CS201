Three laws of recursion:

	- A recursive algorithm must have a base case.
	- A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case.
	- A recursive algorithm must call itself recursively.

Converting an Integer to a String in Any Base

def to_str(n, base):
    convert_string = "0123456789ABCDEF"
    if n < base:
        return convert_string[n]
    else:
        return to_str(n // base, base) + convert_string[n % base]

print(to_str(1453, 16))

Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns a new string that is the reverse of the old string.

def reverse(s):
    if len(s) <= 1:
        return s
    else:
        return reverse(s[1:]) + s[0]
