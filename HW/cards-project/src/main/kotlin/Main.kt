/** Reflection
 *  I really hated this assignment. At a high level, drawing on a whiteboard, I can certainly conceptually understand the methods of doubly linked lists and implement
 * them in certain, simpler, cases (e.g. every single function except tripleCut) but then there are times when I try to translate the whiteboard understanding, keeping track of 
 * every single pointer in every node and making sure that they are accounted for, and then the computer gets my code and just makes me question.... life. Like the interpreter-compiler
 * combo that reads my lines was built by a human and they know what I want to do, but find some technicality that in the transposition of a subsection of a circular doubly linked list
 * the pointers in between the values that arent being changed also needs to be carefully monitored. At some point I figured that it was probably just easier to cut everything away, and then
 * compose the deck like it would have been done in real life. *breathes in* *breathes out* Ok. Fine. Apart from triplecut() I feel relatively confident in my doubly linked list expertise. 
 * 
 * I spent 12 hours on this assignment.
