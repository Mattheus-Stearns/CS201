What does 'target object' mean? (p.g. 40)
As in, how are run and let different functions? (p.g. 40)
If we want to keep our structures read-only for safety, then would it be best practice for all of the structures to be read-only while they are in storage, and then making them mutable specifically when we want to modify them? (p.g. 46)
Would you recommend following the classes up with study from the textbook? If so, what exercises should I do each week of this course?
