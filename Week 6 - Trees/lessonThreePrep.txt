Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

Which of the following binary trees are valid binary search trees? Why?
	A	B	C
	3	8	14
	^       ^      	 ^
       2      6  10	9  21
       ^      ^   ^	^    ^
      1      5 7 9 11  2 11 12

A, B and C are valid BSTs because each value has two children, and the left child has a smaller value than the parent node, and the right child has a higher value than the root node.

Given the following BST, what will it look like after trying to insert 42?

     49
      ^
   24    62
   ^      ^
  9 31   54 73


     49
      ^
   24    62
   ^      ^
  9 31   54 73
	 ^
	42

What will the same BST look like after trying to delete 49?

     54
      ^
   24    62
   ^      ^
  9 31     73
