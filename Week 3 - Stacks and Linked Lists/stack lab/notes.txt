For both the Array Stack implementation and the Mutable List implementation I chose to have the "top" of the stack to be the last element of the array/list. I figured that the O(1) implementation where I was indexing in to the last element and messing around with it was better than the O(n) implementation where I am messing around with the first element of the list and having to copy all of the other elements to their position + 1 would be suboptimal. Of course, I am making assumptions that it is easier to access the last element of the lists, where there are other data structures where the first element is easier to access.
