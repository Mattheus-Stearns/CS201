Hash Table (with Linear Probing)

	Keys	Values
0	"n"	17
1	"a"	3
2	"b"	2
3	"g"	7
4	
5
6

If you want to add "j" -> 10 to the hash table, you have to check the 3rd index of your table, which is "g" -> 7, then check the 4th index, which is free, and then insert "j" -> 10. This is what the table looks like after that:

	Keys	Values
0	"n"	17
1	"a"	3
2	"b"	2
3	"g"	7
4	"j"	10
5
6

For double hashing to be effective at all, it must never return 0.
